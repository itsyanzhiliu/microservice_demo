# Microservice Demo
- Function-Driven Service Splitting:
  - Breaking down the application into independent services based on distinct business functions, such as order service, user service, and payment service.
 
- RESTful API Remote Communication:
  -   Using HTTP and RESTful API to enable remote communication between microservices. Each microservice exposes APIs to expose its functionality and allows interaction using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
